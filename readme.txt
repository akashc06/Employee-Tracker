Employee Tracker is a combination of web as well as android app. The app is developed to facilitate the employers (to track) employee who are involved in field work. The app provides services such as GPS tracker, authentication, image capture, etc. The app begins with user login on the smart phone which is followed by an image capture and the GPS location of the user is sent to the admin. This helps the admin in monitoring the whereabouts of a large number of employees with ease from the web app.
The user app or the android app on the employee’s side provides authentication service, and sends the GPS location along with the image of the employee.
The web app on the employer’s side will take the image and the GPS location as inputs and processes it. Thus allowing the admin to keep tabs on the employee’s location. The user app doesn’t have a built-in face recognition system, it only captures the image and forwards the same for further processing at the admin end.
